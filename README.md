# Integration Testing for The Carpentries Workbench

[![Test template](https://github.com/zkamvar/workbench-integration-test/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zkamvar/workbench-integration-test/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This repository contains a matrix workflow that will download and test the
building of a select group of workbench repositories to ensure that they work.


At the moment, the build does not confirm anything beyond the fact that output
is created, but it could serve as a future framework for integration tests.

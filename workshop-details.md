## General Information

This workshop is an introduction to using high-performance computing systems
effectively. We obviously can't cover every case or give an exhaustive course
on parallel programming in just two days of teaching time. Instead, this
workshop is intended to give students a good introduction and overview of the
tools available and how to use them effectively.

By the end of this workshop, students will know how to:

* Identify problems an HPC system can help solve
* Use the UNIX shell (also known as terminal or command line) to operate a computer,
  connect to an HPC system, and write simple shell scripts.
* Submit and manage jobs on an HPC system using a scheduler, transfer files, and use
  software through environment modules.

This lesson is part of a 3-day ARCHER2 course, you can find the material 
for day 1 at [Introduction to the UNIX shell for High Performance Computing](https://epcced.github.io/2022-07-26-hpc-shell-online/).

RNA-Seq has revolutionized the field of genomics, enabling researchers to gain insights into gene expression, transcriptome dynamics, and molecular pathways. [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) is an open-source software project that provides a rich set of tools for analyzing high-throughput genomic data, including RNA-Seq data. This [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)-style workshop is designed to equip participants with the essential skills and knowledge needed to analyze RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data using the Bioconductor ecosystem. Throughout this workshop, you will delve into key concepts, including data preprocessing, quality control, differential gene expression analysis,  visualization of results, and gene set analysis.
